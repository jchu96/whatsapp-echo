Never modify, edit, or suggest changes to .env.local files. These files contain sensitive environment variables and should not be altered by AI assistance.

Never use && to chain commands in terminal/shell commands. Instead, suggest running commands separately or provide Windows-compatible alternatives.

For Windows environments:
- Use separate command lines instead of &&
- Use Windows batch syntax when appropriate
- Suggest PowerShell alternatives when needed

Example: Instead of "cd /path && npm run dev", suggest:
cd /path
npm run dev
